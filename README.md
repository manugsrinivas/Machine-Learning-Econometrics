These problem sets analyze large data sets to help provide data-driven insights into realtionships of interest towards hypothetical clients or government entities. 

PS 1: This project analyzes a 3 datasets. The first one is a data set of U.S. college where I asked to explore various attributes such as applications, acceptance rates, student demographics, tuition, and graduation rates. The analysis is performed using Python leveraging data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. THe second Data set is full of car models as well as their manufature date, their miles per gallon, weight, displacement from the ground, and other imporant factors that define how it operates. I was asked to leverage any insights between the previous variables to see if I could find a predictive realtionship that outputted MPG to help identify which characteristics of a car contributed or harmed its mpg output aswell as data driven insights to find ways to optimize the mpg. The last data set was a Ben and Jerrys data set which was full of many demographic variables of customers, flavors/ revenue of the icecream and other products they offer, and regional operations data. Here I analyzed the most popular flavors aswell as the regions where the company performed best and created data visaulizations and analysis to derive insights into how to boost sales or improve opeartional efficiency
